Armory is an open-source 3D game engine focused on portability, minimal footprint and performance. The renderer is fully scriptable with deferred and forward paths supported out of the box.

Armory as a Blender add-on provides a full Blender integration, turning it into a complete game development tool and a unified workflow from start to finish.
